# Overview

This is a basic Hello World! program. It simply displays the traditional "Hello World!" text. I created this to demonstrate the use of Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Python integrated together.

I've created a demo of this program that you can view here. [Hello World Demo Video](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/fd7aNqaXDXaZqTJzK8qMmL?)

# Development Environment

The tools I used to create this program are:

- Visual Studio Code
- Python 3.10.11 64-bit
- Git/GitHub

I used the Python language because it is very commonly used and easy to learn.
